Figure: Tic-tac-toe

# How is tic-tac-toe played?
- The game is played between two players on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. 
- If a player decides to select X, the other player will take O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. 
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a straight row wins. 
- If all the 9 squares are full but none of the players can get 3 of their marks in a row, it's a draw. 
- Next, we will focus on how we will create this project.
