# Project Introduction
In this project, we will create a simple game called rock paper scissors by creating objects. So be sure to revise objects and classes before you proceed.

# Working of the game
If you don't know, here's how the game works:

- This game is played between two players. 
- Each player can choose either rock or paper or scissors. 
- If both players choose the same thing, it's a draw.

However, if the players choose different things, one will win and the other will lose. The rule is:
- rock - scissors: rock will win (rock crushes scissors)
- rock - paper: paper will win (paper covers rock)
- scissors - paper: scissors win (scissors cuts paper)

# Project Description
Here's how our project works:

- This game will be played between the computer and the user. 
- The computer will randomly pick either rock, paper or scissors. The user will not know what the computer's pick. 
- The user will be asked to choose either rock, paper or scissors. 
- We will compare the computer's pick and the user's pick and decide whether the user won or lost or drew.

ðŸ’¡Note: We have created this game in the Python Basics course using functions. Now we will create this game using an object-oriented programming approach.
